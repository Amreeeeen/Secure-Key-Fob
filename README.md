# Secure-Key-Fob
Developed a prototype key fob system implementing Diffie-Hellman key exchange and SHA-256 hashing for secure communication.
# Secure Key Fob Using Diffie-Hellman & SHA-256

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a secure key fob system using **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** to generate a shared secret and **SHA-256 hashing** to secure communication between a device and a server.

## Features
- Secure key exchange without transmitting the actual key
- Encrypted communication using SHA-256
- Prototype implemented in Python
- Demonstrates fundamentals of cryptography for IoT devices

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- hashlib (SHA-256)
- Random number generation for key exchange

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Secure-Key-Fob.git
